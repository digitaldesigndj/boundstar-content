## "Tiny Tower" Build Event Weekend, January 18-20

### How this will work:

<p>This event will span the entire weekend</p>
<p>The tower is 50 FLOORS tall, and is located to the right of spawn</p>
<p>Each player is welcome to furnish ONE floor of the tower however they like (Once finished, the floor is yours!)</p>
<p>ONLY build on an empty floor closest to ground level</p>
<p>Unlike the previous build event, this will be hosted on the main server so no registration/sign-up is required</p>
<p>Spawn will still be protected so while the event is open to anybody to participate, you will still need to get permission-to-build from an admin before you can start</p>
