## Troubleshooting

Restart your Starbound client. Listen to the Chucklefish and learn to love it. Server instances will only introduce more connection issues. You best bet is to wait on the server to wake up, it may take 20-60 seconds. Restart your client and check the forums real quick. Patience will solve most issues.

If issues really arent solved, you can report it. A 'down server' button may be in order. One that will restart the server with enough votes.
