## Welcome to the wiki site!

This is another part of the Boundstar website, A wiki you can [edit with Github](https://github.com/digitaldesigndj/boundstar-content/edit/master/info.html.md) or Prose. Pull requests welcome!

If you have any questions send a chat message (on the forum) to Munlock!

Restart your Starbound client. Listen to the Chucklefish and learn to love it. Server instances will only introduce more connection issues. You best bet is to wait on the server to wake up, it may take 20-60 seconds. Restart your client and check the forums real quick. Patience will solve most issues.

If issues really arent solved, you can report it. A 'down server' button may be in order. One that will restart the server with enough votes.

The forum is where we communicate and post things about the servers. You have to link your forum profile to your player profile to get past the first rank. You also need 1 post and 1 reputation.
